# Bedrock coverage for the RaceBench corpus, via FORK-BASED fuzzing: how many of
# the 60 injected bugs the concurrency-fuzz scheduler reaches UNDER bedrock
# (single vCPU, emulated TSC, thread-fuzz SCHED_EXT). Counterpart to baseline.sh:
# run the two and compare TOTALs.
#
# WHY FORK (not cold boot per seed). The strict late-inject abort (a late
# APIC-timer delivery aborts the run) fires during EARLY BOOT, so cold-booting a
# fresh guest per seed is no longer viable. Instead we boot ONE parent guest to
# the post-boot ready checkpoint and hold it there, then fork a re-seeded child
# per seed off it (copy-on-write):
#   - the expensive boot (kernel + podman + image load) is paid ONCE and shared;
#   - the early-boot late injects happen only in the throwaway parent, which
#     tolerates them (BEDROCK_IGNORE_LATE_INJECT=1, set by the parent app);
#   - each scored child runs STRICT, so a late inject inside a real schedule
#     aborts and is caught (logged here as a LATE-INJECT ABORT) rather than
#     silently diverging.
#
# A child's schedule is a pure function of its child seed (the getrandom stream
# the in-kernel fuzzing scheduler draws), exactly as a cold boot's was, so
# coverage still comes from sweeping the CHILD seed across forks, not from
# re-running one seed. Because it is deterministic, this sweep needs no reps:
# re-running the same (boot_seed, child-seed range) reproduces byte-identical
# coverage. The repro of a triggered bug is (target, input, boot_seed, child_seed).
#
# Each fork runs the full corpus (all three targets) once and prints one line per
# target to serial:
#   "<name>: BUG TRIGGERED (rc=134) bug_ids: 3 7"   or   "<name>: no trigger ..."
# We union bug_ids per target across forks and plateau per target, exactly like
# baseline.sh -- same PLATEAU/MAX semantics so the numbers are comparable.
#
# Prerequisites (run this ON THE HOST where bedrock is loaded, e.g. galactus):
#   - bedrock module loaded (lsmod | grep bedrock) and /dev/bedrock present
#   - workload image built: cd .. && ./build.sh
#   - the seed knobs drive bedrock-cli -s: BOOT_SEED for the parent boot,
#     RDRAND_SEED for each child fork (see the fork apps in flake.nix).
#
# Usage (capture to a dated, host-tagged file like the baseline does):
#   ./bedrock.sh 2>&1 | tee "bedrock-$(hostname -s)-$(date +%F).txt"
#
# WARNING: PLATEAU=500 is still many forks; a fork is far cheaper than a cold
# boot (no Linux boot) but not free. Start small to sanity check, e.g.
# PLATEAU=20 MAX=100 ./bedrock.sh, then raise for the real number.
#
# Env knobs:
#   SEED_BASE   first CHILD seed; fork i uses SEED_BASE + (i-1)      (default 1)
#   BOOT_SEED   parent boot seed; fixes the one-time throwaway boot  (default 0)
#   PLATEAU     stop a target after this many forks add no new bug   (default 500)
#   MAX         hard cap on forks                                    (default 20000)
#   PARENT_READY_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for the parent to reach
#               the ready checkpoint before giving up               (default 300)
#   BEDROCK_PREEMPT_PERIOD  forced-preempt period per child, retired
#               instructions                                        (default 0=off)
#   BEDROCK_WATCHPOINT_PCT  EPT write-watchpoint directed-preempt
#               chance % per shared write                           (default 0=off)
#   BEDROCK_WATCHPOINT_REARM  sampling re-arm interval, emulated-TSC
#               ticks; 0 uses the CLI default (100k)                (default 0)
#   BEDROCK_WATCHPOINT_CULL_EPOCHS  cull a watched page after N
#               epochs without spanning a switch                    (default 2)
#   BEDROCK_WATCHPOINT_CULL_CAP  fault-count backstop cull          (default 256)
# The preempt/watchpoint knobs are recorded in the run header so a triggered
# bug's repro -- (guest build, boot_seed, child_seed, these knobs) -- is complete.
